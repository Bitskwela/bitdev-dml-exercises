## Lesson 14 Exercises: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

---
### 1. NumPy Array Math (6 minutes)
Create array [5,10,15,20]; add 3 to each; compute mean, std.

---
### 2. DataFrame Creation (7 minutes)
Build DataFrame from dict: names ["Ana","Ben","Carla"], ages [21,19,23]. Print head().

---
### 3. CSV Load (7 minutes)
Use pd.read_csv on sample file; print info() and describe().

---
### 4. Column Selection (6 minutes)
Extract "name" and "age" columns as new DataFrame.

---
### 5. Filtering Practice (8 minutes)
Filter rows where age >= 18 AND status == "Approved".

---
### 6. Group Aggregation (8 minutes)
Group by barangay; compute mean age per barangay.

---
### 7. Line Plot (7 minutes)
Plot quarterly applicant counts [100,110,105,115] with labels.

---
### 8. Bar Chart (7 minutes)
Bar chart: barangay names vs applicant counts (3 barangays).

---
### 9. Histogram (7 minutes)
Histogram of ages with 10 bins; add title and axis labels.

---
### 10. Stretch: Multi-Plot Dashboard (Optional)
Subplot grid: line plot + bar chart + histogram in one figure.

---
### 11. Reflection (3 minutes)
Two insights visualizations reveal faster than raw tables.
