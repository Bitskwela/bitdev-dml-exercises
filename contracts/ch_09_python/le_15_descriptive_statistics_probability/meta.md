## Lesson 15 Exercises: Statistics & Probability

---
### 1. Central Tendency (7 minutes)
Data: [15, 18, 21, 21, 19, 30, 17]. Compute mean, median, mode.

---
### 2. Spread Measures (7 minutes)
Same data: compute range, variance, std dev using statistics module.

---
### 3. Quartiles & IQR (8 minutes)
Compute Q1, Q3, IQR using np.percentile.

---
### 4. Outlier Detection (8 minutes)
Identify outliers using IQR rule (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR).

---
### 5. Approval Probability (6 minutes)
500 applicants, 320 approved. Calculate P(approved).

---
### 6. Conditional Probability (8 minutes)
Of 320 approved, 200 were seniors. Compute P(senior | approved).

---
### 7. Z-Score Calculation (7 minutes)
Mean age 22, std 3. Compute z-score for age 28.

---
### 8. Independent Events (7 minutes)
P(rain) = 0.3, P(traffic) = 0.4 (independent). Compute P(rain AND traffic).

---
### 9. Stretch: Distribution Visualization (Optional)
Generate 1000 samples from normal distribution (mean 22, std 3); plot histogram.

---
### 10. Reflection (3 minutes)
Two reasons median more reliable than mean for skewed data.
