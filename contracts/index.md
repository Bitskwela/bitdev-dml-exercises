## Prologue: A Story-Driven Path from Zero to Hero

This repository is more than a single Solidity bootcamp. It is a curated ecosystem of multi-language chapters built around Filipino scenarios, story arcs (with characters like Neri), and progressive exercises that range from Solidity smart contracts to web apps, data science, and systems programming. Every track couples theory with verifiable Hardhat or Python tooling so learners practice both implementation and testing.

### What You'll Explore

Each course below targets a unique skill slice while staying grounded in the same narrative universe:

1. **Basic Solidity (Chapter 1)** – Core Solidity syntax, data structures, functions, events, and security fundamentals delivered through immersive storytelling.
2. **Solidity Side Quests (Chapter 2)** – Focused challenges that reinforce token flows, reentrancy protection, and advanced on-chain logic.
3. **Solidity Mini Projects (Chapter 3)** – Wallets, staking, lending, and retail contracts that form complete product scenarios.
4. **DApp Development (Chapter 4)** – Full-stack experiences integrating Solidity contracts with JavaScript frontends, MetaMask, and deployment workflows.
5. **JavaScript Fundamentals (Chapter 5)** – Language essentials for web and blockchain tooling that prepare learners for frontend and tooling layers.
6. **JS Mini Projects (Chapter 6)** – Practice applications mirroring administrative, retail, and community scenarios.
7. **Full-Stack Web Development (Chapter 7)** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python/Flask lessons culminating in data-driven web apps.
8. **C++ from Zero to Hero (Chapter 8)** – Systems programming foundations, data structures, and user-facing CRUD projects.
9. **Python Programming (Chapter 9)** – Databases, data science with NumPy/Pandas, Flask APIs, and a capstone resident management system.
10. **Move Language (Chapter 12)** – Resource-oriented programming for Move ecosystems (Sui, Aptos) covering ownership, generics, testing, and security patterns.

### Learning Principles

- **Story + Filipino Context**: Each lesson ties back to real-world Filipinx experiences—barangay funds, jeepney fares, palengke merchants—so abstract concepts become relatable.
- **Hands-on Verification**: Lessons ship with Hardhat tests or Python scripts that prove student solutions behave as intended.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Courses sequence from syntax and fundamentals to advanced architecture, testing, and deployment.
