# Tasks for Learners

Neri wants to build a Community Fund contract that allows people to donate funds. However, to ensure the integrity of the system, donations can only be accepted if they meet the following conditions:

- Inside the `donate` function, ensure that donations can only be made with a non-zero amount.

- Add a condition that checks if the amount donated equals the amount sent (using `msg.value`).

- Inside the `withdraw` function, only allow the contract owner to withdraw funds.

- Ensure the `withdraw` function verifies there are enough funds before allowing a withdrawal.

- If any of these conditions fail, the transaction should be rejected.

## Smart contract activity

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CommunityFund {
    address public fundOwner;
    uint256 public totalDonations;

    constructor() {
        fundOwner = msg.sender; // The contract creator is the fund owner
    }

    // Function to donate to the fund
    function donate(uint256 amount) public payable {
        // ðŸš© Task 1: Use require to ensure the donation amount is greater than zero
        require(amount > 0, "Donation must be greater than zero");

        // ðŸš© Task 2: Ensure the sender has enough Ether to make the donation
        require(msg.value == amount, "Insufficient Ether provided");

        totalDonations += amount; // Update the total donations
    }

    // Function to withdraw funds (only the owner can withdraw)
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        // ðŸš© Task 3: Ensure only the owner can withdraw funds
        require(msg.sender == fundOwner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");

        // ðŸš© Task 4: Ensure enough funds are available to withdraw
        require(amount <= totalDonations, "Not enough funds");

        totalDonations -= amount;
        payable(fundOwner).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

### Breakdown for Learners

`require` is a guardrail: It acts as a checkpoint to ensure that the contract operates within the defined rules. If the condition in `require` is not met, the transaction is **stopped**, and any changes made to the contract state are reverted.

**Why use require?**

- Security: Prevents invalid operations from affecting the contract state (e.g., Hackana trying to withdraw funds without meeting conditions).

- Efficiency: require helps enforce conditions before performing costly operations or state changes, saving gas when conditions arenâ€™t met.
