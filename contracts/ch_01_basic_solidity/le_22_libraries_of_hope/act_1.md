# Task for Learners

Neri needs to create a library to simplify common mathematical operations for validating transactions. Your task is to:

- Define a library named `MathLibrary`.

```solidity
library MathLibrary {
    function calculatePercentage(
        uint256 base,
        uint256 percent
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (base * percent) / 100;
    }
}
```

- Implement a function `calculatePercentage` inside the `HackanaDefense` contract to calculate transaction fees using the library.

```solidity
    function calculateFee(
        uint256 transactionAmount,
        uint256 feePercent
    ) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return MathLibrary.calculatePercentage(transactionAmount, feePercent);
    }
```

### Breakdown of Activity

**Library Definition:**

- The `MathLibrary` is defined to perform mathematical operations.
- A function `calculatePercentage` is implemented for percentage-based calculations.

**Library Usage:**

- The **HackanaDefense** contract uses MathLibrary to calculate transaction fees in the `calculateFee` function.

### Closing Story

Neri successfully deploys her newly crafted library to San Juan City's blockchain defenses. The library optimizes transaction validation and ensures wallets process payments securely and efficiently.

Hackana, unable to exploit the hardened systems, retreats into digital obscurity.

With the city's digital economy stabilized, Neri celebrates with her community, knowing libraries have become her secret weapon for the future. ðŸŽ‰
