- **Define the Token Contract**:
  Inherit from the ERC20 contract to get access to its predefined functionalities.
- **Constructor Initialization**:
  Name the token _SanJuanToken_ with the symbol _SJT_.
  Mint an initial supply of tokens to the deployerâ€™s address.

### Closing Story

With the launch of **SanJuanToken**, Neri witnesses a revolutionary shift in the city. Vendors, jeepney drivers, and even local artists use the token to trade goods, services, and ideas.

The community is stronger, and Hackana's grip weakens further as Neri's systems gain resilience and trust. She knows the battle isn't over, but for now, she smiles, watching her city thrive through the power of decentralized technology.
