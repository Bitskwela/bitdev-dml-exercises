import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract UserRegistryV1 {
    // Mapping to store user addresses and their names
    mapping(address => string) public userNames;

    function initialize() public /*initializer*/ {

    }

    function registerUser(string memory name) public {
        userNames[msg.sender] = name;

    function getUser(address user) public view returns (string memory) {
        return userNames[user];
    }
}

contract UserRegistryV2 {}

```

## Task for Learners

- Import the `Initializable` contract from OpenZeppelin.
  ```solidity
  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
  ```
- Complete the `UserRegistryV2` contract by extending `UserRegistryV1`. Add a function `updateUser` that allows users to update their names.
  Create an upgradable contract that stores a list of registered users. In the first version, users can only register. In the second version, add functionality to update user details.
  ```solidity
  contract UserRegistryV2 is UserRegistryV1 {
      function updateUser(string memory newName) public {
          userNames[msg.sender] = newName;
      }
  }
  ```

### Breakdown of the Activity

**Imports:** Imported Initializable from OpenZeppelin to support initialization.

**UserRegistryV1:**

- `initialize()`: Sets up the contract, required for upgradeable contracts.
- `registerUser()`: Allows users to register by storing their names.
- `getUser()`: Retrieves the name of a registered user.

**UserRegistryV2:**

- Extends `UserRegistryV1`.
- Adds the `updateUser()` function, enabling users to modify their names.

**Upgrading Process:**

- Deploy `UserRegistryV1` with a proxy.
- Upgrade the proxy to point to `UserRegistryV2`.

### Closing Story

As Hackana morphs into its final form, launching its most destructive attack yet, Neri's adaptive contracts come to life.

With every assault, her team deploys real-time updates, nullifying Hackana's every move. The dynamic system evolves faster than the malware can adapt, leading to Hackana's ultimate defeat.

The battle isn't just wonâ€”Neri's strategy transforms how systems defend against threats, heralding a new era of resilient, evolving digital infrastructure.
