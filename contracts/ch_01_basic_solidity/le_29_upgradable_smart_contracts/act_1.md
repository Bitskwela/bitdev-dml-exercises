# Task for Learners

Create an upgradable contract that stores a list of registered users. In the first version, users can only register. In the second version, add functionality to update user details.

### Breakdown of the Activity

**Imports:** Imported Initializable from OpenZeppelin to support initialization.

**UserRegistryV1:**

- `initialize()`: Sets up the contract, required for upgradeable contracts.
- `registerUser()`: Allows users to register by storing their names.
- `getUser()`: Retrieves the name of a registered user.

**UserRegistryV2:**

- Extends `UserRegistryV1`.
- Adds the `updateUser()` function, enabling users to modify their names.

**Upgrading Process:**

- Deploy `UserRegistryV1` with a proxy.
- Upgrade the proxy to point to `UserRegistryV2`.

### Closing Story

As Hackana morphs into its final form, launching its most destructive attack yet, Neri's adaptive contracts come to life.

With every assault, her team deploys real-time updates, nullifying Hackana's every move. The dynamic system evolves faster than the malware can adapt, leading to Hackana's ultimate defeat.

The battle isn't just wonâ€”Neri's strategy transforms how systems defend against threats, heralding a new era of resilient, evolving digital infrastructure.
