# Task for Learners

- Define a custom error related to insufficient funds.
- Implement a function that uses this custom error to revert on failure.
- Optimize error handling by replacing require or revert strings with custom errors.

### Breakdown of the Activity

**Custom Errors Defined**

- `UnauthorizedAccess(address caller)`: Throws if a non-owner tries to withdraw funds.
- `InsufficientFunds(uint256 requested, uint256 available)`: Throws if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.

**Functions**

- `withdraw`: Checks if the caller is the contract owner. If not, reverts with `UnauthorizedAccess`.

  Validates the balance is sufficient. If not, reverts with `InsufficientFunds`.

- `checkBalance`: Returns the current total balance.

#### Example Usage

**Successful Withdrawal:**

- Caller: Owner
- Amount: Less than or equal to `totalBalance`.
- Outcome: `totalBalance` reduces, function completes successfully.

**Failure Scenarios:**

- Unauthorized Caller: Reverts with `UnauthorizedAccess`.
- Insufficient Balance: Reverts with `InsufficientFunds`.

### Closing Story

Neriâ€™s team successfully deploys the updated defensive contracts equipped with custom error handling. Hackanaâ€™s attempts to disrupt the blockchain are met with efficient and gas-optimized responses.

Thanks to their robust design, the communityâ€™s digital infrastructure remains intact, and Neri is hailed as the heroine who safeguarded decentralized systems for all.
