### Breakdown of the Activity

**Array Defined:**

- `payments`: A dynamic array of `uint256` to store payment amounts.

**Key Functions:**

- `recordPayment`: Accepts a payment amount as input.
  Adds it to the payments array using the push() function.
- `getTotalPayments`: Returns the total number of payments stored in the array by accessing its length property.
- `getPayment`: Retrieves a specific payment by its index.
  Uses a require statement to ensure the index is valid.
