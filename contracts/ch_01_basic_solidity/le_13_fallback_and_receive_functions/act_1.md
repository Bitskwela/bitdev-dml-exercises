### Smart Contract Activity

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BarangayWallet {}
```

# Task for Learners

- Add a state variable to track the total Ether received by the contract named `totalReceived`.

  ```solidity
      uint256 public totalReceived;
  ```

- Create and event named `InvalidCall` to log invalid calls to the smart contract. It should include the following parameters:

  - `address sender`: The address of the sender.
  - `uint256 value`: The amount of Ether sent.
  - `bytes data`: The raw calldata of the function call.

    ```solidity
        event InvalidCall(address sender, uint256 value, bytes data);
    ```

- Add a receive function to handle Ether transfers

  ```solidity
      receive() external payable {
          totalReceived += msg.value;
      }
  ```

- Add a fallback function to log invalid calls to the smart contract and emit the `InvalidCall` event.

  ```solidity
      fallback() external payable {
          emit InvalidCall(msg.sender, msg.value, msg.data);
      }
  ```

### Breakdown of Activity

**State Variable Defined:**

`totalReceived`: Tracks the total Ether received by the contract.

**Receive Function:**

- Purpose: Accepts Ether sent directly to the contract without any data.
- Logic: Adds the amount sent (`msg.value`) to the `totalReceived` state variable.

**Fallback Function:**

Purpose: Handles invalid function calls or Ether transfers with data.
Logic: Emits an event to log the sender, value, and calldata of the invalid call.

**Event Declared:**

```solidity
InvalidCall(address sender, uint256 value, bytes data);
```

Logs the sender address, amount of Ether sent, and the raw calldata.

### Closing Story

During the Tech Fair, Neri demonstrates a Barangay Wallet smart contract. When attendees send Ether directly to the contract, the receive function tracks the funds. If they try calling non-existent functions, the fallback function logs the action.

The crowd cheers as Neri explains:
**“Ang blockchain ay parang guardya—lagi kang may planong pang-backup sa kahit anong posibleng mangyari.”**

(_Blockchain is like a guard—always prepared with a backup plan for anything that might happen._)

Neri’s next mission? Helping the barangay distribute ayuda funds through transparent mechanisms!
