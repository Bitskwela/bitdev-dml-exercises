# Task for Learners

Hackanaâ€™s new malware exploits contracts with redundant code. Your task is to:

- Create a base contract with shared functionality.
- Build a child contract that inherits from the base contract and extends its logic.

### Breakdown of Activity

**Task 1**:

In the `setOrganizationName` function, we added a `require` statement:

```solidity
require(bytes(name).length > 0, "Name cannot be empty");
```

- Purpose: This ensures the name provided is not empty before assigning it to organizationName.

**Task 2**:

In the `depositFunds` function, we added a `require` statement:

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
```

- Purpose: This validates that the deposit `amount` is greater than zero before updating the `fundBalance`.

### Closing Story

Neri uses an analogy to explain inheritance to her team:
"**Parang pamilya ito: ang base contract ay ang magulang, at ang derived contract ay ang anak. Ang anak ay may minana sa magulang, pero puwede rin itong magdagdag ng sariling katangian.**"

(_Itâ€™s like a family: the base contract is the parent, and the derived contract is the child. The child inherits traits from the parent but can also add its own features._)

As they implement the **BaseContract** and **DerivedContract**, the team notices how inheritance makes their code cleaner and easier to update.

Hackanaâ€™s malware struggles against this new modular structure, forcing it to retreat once more. Neri smiles, knowing that every improvement brings them closer to victory.
