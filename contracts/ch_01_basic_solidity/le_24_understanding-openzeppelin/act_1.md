# Task for Learners

Neri needs your help to create a new ERC20 token using OpenZeppelin. This will be the currency used for rebuilding systems destroyed by Hackana.

## Smart Contract Activity

Using OpenZeppelin, letâ€™s create an ERC20 token

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// ðŸš© TODO: Import the ERC20 contract from OpenZeppelin
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// ðŸš© TODO: Create a custom token contract
contract HackanaDefenseToken is ERC20 {
    // ðŸš© TODO: Add a constructor to initialize the token
    constructor() ERC20("DefenseToken", "DEF") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10 ** decimals()); // ðŸš© Initial supply
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of Activity

**Imports**

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```

Allows the contract to inherit OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC20 implementation.

**Constructor**

Initializes the token with a name (_DefenseToken_), symbol (_DEF_), and initial supply.

`msg.sender`: The account deploying the contract receives the initial supply.

**Mint Function**

```solidity
_mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10 ** decimals());
```

Mints 1000 tokens and assigns them to msg.sender.

**ERC20 Benefits**

- Handles token transfers, approvals, and balances securely.
- Prevents common vulnerabilities like reentrancy.

### Closing Story

As Neri introduces the DefenseToken to the community, she sees a spark of hope reignite in their eyes. Vendors in the palengke begin using the token for transactions, jeepney drivers adopt it for QR-based fares, and even barangay halls accept it for local permits.

With OpenZeppelinâ€™s robust framework ensuring security, Neri manages to establish trust among the people, reassuring them that their funds are safe. The token quickly becomes a symbol of resilience, uniting San Juan City against Hackanaâ€™s looming threat.

Hackana, sensing the cityâ€™s newfound strength, deploys a malicious smart contract to disrupt the DefenseToken network. But Neriâ€™s preparations, backed by OpenZeppelinâ€™s audited code, ensure the token holds strong.

San Juan begins to rebuild stronger than ever, and Neri knows sheâ€™s one step closer to vanquishing Hackana for good.
