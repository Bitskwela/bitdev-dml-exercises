# Lesson 1: What is the Internet?

## Background Story

Tian, a Grade 10 student from Batangas, was super excited when the principal announced that the school now has internet access! But while loading Facebook and YouTube, Tian suddenly thought: "How does this actually work? Why can I see my classmates' posts right away even though Facebook's server is far away in America?"

Tian called cousin Kuya Miguel, a freelance web developer in Manila. They had a video call (using the school's new internet!), and that's where Tian's adventure into the world of web development began.

## What Really is the Internet?

### The Big Picture

Imagine the whole world as one giant barangay. All the houses (computers and devices) are connected to one super large network of roads and streets. You can send letters, pictures, videos, or anything to other houses in just a few seconds. That's basically the **Internet**!

The **Internet** is a global network connecting BILLIONS of computers, phones, and devices worldwide. It's not owned by a single company (like, there's no "Internet Corporation" that's the boss of it). It's more like a worldwide system that everyone agreed to use.

### How Did the Internet Start in the Philippines?

The Internet arrived in the Philippines in 1994 — almost 30 years ago! Our first ISP was PhilCom (PLDT's internet service). Imagine, your parents were probably still young back then, and there was no Facebook, TikTok, or Mobile Legends. Only email and simple websites were used back then.

Now? We have millions of Filipinos online every day. In fact, the Philippines is one of the top countries in the world when it comes to social media usage. The average Filipino spends around **10+ hours per day** online! (Including streaming, gaming, social media, and online class)

## Key Concepts: What You Should Know

### 1. IP Address - The Address of Each Device

Think of an **IP Address** as the home address of your device on the Internet. Just like how your house has a house number and street name, every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address.

Example of an IP address: `192.168.1.1` or `142.250.185.46`

If you want to see the IP address of your device now:
- You can Google "What is my IP"
- Or type in your browser: `whatismyipaddress.com`

**Fun fact:** There are two types of IP addresses:
- **IPv4** - the old one, like `192.168.1.1` (almost running out of available addresses!)
- **IPv6** - the new one, much longer like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` (for future needs)

### 2. Router - The Traffic Enforcer of the Internet

The **Router** is like a traffic enforcer or dispatcher. When you send a message or load a website, the router is what directs where your data should go.

In your home, your WiFi router connects all your devices (phone, laptop, TV, PS4) to the internet. You all have different IP addresses internally, but you share one public IP address going out to the internet.

**Analogy:** Like a jeepney terminal. All passengers (data) pass through the terminal (router), and the dispatcher (router) tells which jeep (network path) to board to reach the destination.

### 3. ISP (Internet Service Provider) - Who Provides Internet Access

The **ISP** is the company that gives you access to the internet. In the Philippines, the common ISPs are:
- **PLDT** / Smart
- **Globe** / TM
- **Converge**
- **Sky Broadband**
- **DITO** (the new telco)

You pay them monthly so you have an internet connection. They have the physical infrastructure — the cables, cell towers, and connections to the bigger internet.

**Think of it this way:** The ISP is like the LRT/MRT system. You buy a ticket (monthly subscription), and they give you access to the rails (internet infrastructure) so you can get anywhere you want to go (any website).

### 4. Protocols - The Rules of the Internet

For the Internet to work, there needs to be rules or a language that everyone follows. This is what we call **protocols**.

The most important protocol is **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). This is the universal language of the internet.

**Simple analogy:** It's like traffic rules. Wherever you drive in the world — Philippines, US, Japan — the meaning of a red light is STOP. Same with internet protocols — all devices worldwide follow the same rules so they can understand each other.

## How Data Travels: The Journey of a Message

Let's say you post a selfie on Instagram. Here's what happens:

1. **Your Device** → Creates the data (your photo + caption)
2. **Your Router** → Receives the data, adds your home's IP address
3. **Your ISP** → Sends it through their network cables/fiber optics
4. **Internet Backbone** → Super fast cables na nag-connect ng ISPs worldwide (may mga cables under the ocean!)
5. **Instagram's ISP** → Receives your data
5. **Instagram's Server** → Saves your photo in their database
6. **Reverse path** → When someone views your post, the process happens in reverse

All of this happens in **milliseconds** — faster than the blink of an eye!

## Common Student Misconceptions

### WRONG: "The Internet and the Web are the same thing"
CORRECT: They are different!
- **Internet** = the infrastructure, the physical network
- **World Wide Web (WWW)** = the service that runs on the Internet (websites, links, browsers)

It's like this: Internet is the road system, Web is the vehicles that run on the roads. There are other services on the Internet aside from the Web — email, gaming, video calls, file transfers.

### WRONG: "WiFi means Internet"
CORRECT: WiFi is just wireless connection to your router
- You can have WiFi but no Internet (like if the bill isn't paid!)
- WiFi is simply the wireless technology to connect your device to the router

### WRONG: "Internet is faster when WiFi signal is stronger"
CORRECT: Internet speed depends on your ISP plan
- Even if your WiFi has full bars, if your plan is only 10 Mbps, it's really only 10 Mbps
- WiFi signal is affected by distance and walls, but speed depends on your actual internet plan

## Real-World Examples in PH Context

**GCash Transactions**: When you send money via GCash, it travels through the internet from your phone → GCash servers → recipient's phone. That's why you need an internet connection!

**Mobile Legends**: Your ping in ML? That's the time it takes for your data (like when you click a skill) to reach the ML servers and come back to you. Lower ping = better gameplay. That's why stable internet is important for gaming.

**Facebook Live**: Real-time video transmission through the internet. Your video feed is being broken into tiny packets and sent to Facebook's servers, then distributed to all viewers. So when your internet is slow, the live stream lags!

## Pro Tips for Students

**Tip 1**: Want to know how fast your internet is? Use speed test websites like `fast.com` or `speedtest.net`

**Tip 2**: When your internet is lagging, check first if someone is downloading or streaming at home. Your bandwidth is shared!

**Tip 3**: Cellular data (4G/5G) and Home WiFi are both connecting you to the Internet, just different paths. Sometimes cellular data is even faster!

**Tip 4**: Is there free WiFi at malls? Be careful! Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts (banks, GCash) on public WiFi because you might get hacked.

## Summary

The Internet is:
- Global network of billions of devices
- Needs infrastructure: routers, ISPs, cables
- Uses protocols (like TCP/IP) so everyone can understand each other
- Different from the Web (Web is just one service on the Internet)
- Revolutionized our lives — communication, education, entertainment, work!

Next lesson, you'll learn how websites actually work and the relationship between your browser and servers. Exciting!

## Closing Story

That evening, Tian sat under the mango tree in their backyard, phone in hand, scrolling through Facebook. But this time, it felt different. Every notification, every message, every loaded photo—Tian now understood the invisible journey happening beneath it all.

"So when I send a message to my classmate in Manila," Tian thought, "my phone connects to the router, then to PLDT's network, through underwater cables, all the way to Facebook's servers in the US, and back... in milliseconds?"

Kuya Miguel's voice echoed in Tian's mind: "The internet isn't magic—it's engineering. And now that you understand how it works, you can start building things on top of it."

Tian opened a new note on the phone and typed: "Next: Learn how websites actually load." The curiosity spark had been lit. Tomorrow, the real learning journey begins.
