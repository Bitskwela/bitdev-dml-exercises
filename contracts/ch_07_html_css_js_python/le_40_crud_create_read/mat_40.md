## Closing Story

Tian implemented Create and Read operations. Users could add new residents (Create) and view all residents (Read). Flask stored data in SQLite. JavaScript displayed it dynamically.

"CRUD is the foundation of all data-driven apps," Kuya Miguel emphasized. "Create, Read, Update, Delete. Master this, and you can build anything."

Tian tested edge cases: empty fields, duplicate entries, special characters. The validation worked. The data persisted. The app was reliable.
