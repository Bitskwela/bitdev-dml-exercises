## Closing Story

Tian fetched data from Flask and dynamically updated the DOM. No page refresh. No form submission. Just smooth, asynchronous updates. Single Page Application behavior.

"This is SPA architecture," Kuya Miguel explained. "The page never reloads. JavaScript handles everything. Flask is just a data API."

Tian loaded resident lists, filtered announcements, paginated eventsall without page refresh. The experience was seamless. Modern. Professional.
