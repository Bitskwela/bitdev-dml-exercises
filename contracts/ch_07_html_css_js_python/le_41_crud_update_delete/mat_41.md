## Closing Story

Tian completed the CRUD cycle: Update existing residents, Delete unwanted entries. Full database control. Full application functionality.

Kuya Miguel reviewed the final code. "You've built a complete web application. Frontend, backend, database, API, authentication, validation. This is production-ready."

Tian deployed the app locally, invited barangay officials to test it. They were amazed. "This is better than our old Excel system!" Captain Cruz exclaimed.
