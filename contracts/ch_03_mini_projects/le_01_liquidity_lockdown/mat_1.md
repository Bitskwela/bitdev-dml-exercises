# Mini Project #1: Liquidity Lockdown – Neri vs. the Phantom Pool

## Background story:

The San Juan Digital Payment System thrives, but an emerging threat lurks. Deep in the DeFi underworld, one of Hackana’s corrupted DEX protocols—codenamed “_Phantom Pool_”—has resurfaced. It exploits poorly locked liquidity to allow rug-pulls.

Neri, the digital guardian of Pinaglabanan, must deploy a new contract that properly locks liquidity and deters malicious exits. The contract must allow LPs (Liquidity Providers) to deposit tokens and lock them for a fixed time. Withdrawals should only be allowed after the lock period expires.

The fate of the retail investors in Barangay Blockchain hangs in the balance.
