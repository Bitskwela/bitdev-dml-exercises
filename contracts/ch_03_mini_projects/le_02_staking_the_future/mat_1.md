## Background story:

Hackana’s bugs once devastated crypto farms in Pampanga, wiping out yield farming operations. With the country stabilizing, farmers are re-entering DeFi to grow wealth sustainably.

Neri must build a simple yet secure staking contract: users stake tokens, and after a set duration, they can withdraw with a 10% yield bonus. It’s time to rebuild the Filipino DeFi farming ecosystem—one stake at a time.

**Time Allotment**: 1 hour

**Topics Covered**: ERC20, Staking, Timestamp Logic, Rewards
