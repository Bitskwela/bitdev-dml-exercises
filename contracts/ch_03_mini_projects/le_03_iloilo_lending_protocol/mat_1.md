# Mini Project #3: Iloilo's Barangay Lending Protocol

## Background story:

In a small barangay in Iloilo, farmers are often trapped in 5-6 lending schemes (loan sharks), borrowing PHP 5,000 but paying back PHP 7,500 or more. They can’t access formal banks. They have no credit score, no collateral, and no protection.

Hackana’s old botnet disrupted rural banking systems, and now the community can’t rely on traditional finance. LGU is helpless. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is too slow. The people need a decentralized solution.

Neri designs a **Barangay Lending Protocol** — a smart contract that allows farmers to request small loans and lenders to offer funds directly, transparently. All activity is recorded on-chain.

**Time Allotment**: 1 hour

**Topics Covered**:

- Structs
- Mappings
- msg.sender and payable
- Events
- Lending (DeFi Logic)

### Bonus Knowledge

- This contract simulates peer-to-peer lending without middlemen.
- You’ve touched on trustless finance — no need for banks.

- A future upgrade could use:

  - Tokenized credit scoring
  - Loan repayments with interest
  - NFT receipts for loan collateral

### Why this project matters?

Every time a student like you builds something that directly addresses Philippine socioeconomic pain points, you become not just a coder, but a nation-builder.
