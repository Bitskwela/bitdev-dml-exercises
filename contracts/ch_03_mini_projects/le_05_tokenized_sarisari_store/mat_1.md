# Mini Project #5: SariSari Token — Tokenizing the Barangay Store Economy

## Background story:

Sari-sari stores are pillars of Filipino barangay life. Aling Nena runs one in North Cotabato, but she struggles to get fair financing.

Inspired by web3, she asks for help to tokenize her store's goods. Each **SST (SariSariToken)** represents ₱1 worth of inventory.

Investors can buy _SST_, and she can issue more when she restocks — but supply must stay limited to prevent inflation.

You must help build the token logic that supports this local micro-economy securely.

## Solidity Topics Covered

- ERC20 Token Standard
- Minting and Supply Control
- Owner-only Access Control
- Use of OpenZeppelin contracts
- `require` statements for validation

**Time Allotment**: 1 hour

**Topics Covered**:

- Access Control & Ownership
- `tx.origin` vs `msg.sender`
- Validations & Require Checks
- Fallback Protection
- Constructor Initialization

### Outcome

By completing this project, you will learn:

- Be fluent in creating real-world ERC20 tokens.
- Understand economic guardrails like caps and access control.
- Be able to tokenize assets in micro-business contexts.
- Be a step closer to elite, top 1% Solidity talent — capable of designing asset-backed crypto economies.
