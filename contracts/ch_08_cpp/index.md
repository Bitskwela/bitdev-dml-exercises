# Chapter 9: C++ from Zero to Hero`

Lay the groundwork of computational thinking. Learn how to break down tasks into commands a machine can follow.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how computers interpret and execute instructions
- Write basic C++ programs with proper syntax
- Use variables and operators to represent and manipulate data
- Implement decision-making logic using conditional statements

## Lessons

1. **The Language of Machines: Intro to C++**  
   Learn how C++ programs are written and executed. Understand the basic structure of a C++ program.

2. **Declaring Data: Variables and Types**  
   Explore how to store different types of data in variables using `int`, `float`, `string`, and more.

3. **Operators as Tools: Making Expressions Work**  
   Master arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to build smart, interactive logic.

4. **Basic Input and Output: Talking to the Console**  
   Use `cin` and `cout` to interact with users and display results.

5. **Understanding Control Flow: Conditions and Branching**  
   Introduce decision-making with `if`, `else`, and nested conditions.
