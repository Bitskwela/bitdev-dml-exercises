## Chapter 2: Logic in Motion

Explore the logic gates of programming. Build dynamic, repeatable logic flows.

### Lessons

6. **Loops 101: Repeating with For, While, and Do-While**  
   Master the three types of loops in C++. Learn when to use each one and control loop execution with `break` and `continue`.

7. **Nested Control: Ifs Inside Loops and Vice Versa**  
   Combine loops with conditions to solve complex problems. Create patterns and multi-dimensional logic.

8. **Logical Operators and Compound Conditions**  
   Build sophisticated conditions using `&&`, `||`, and `!`. Master operator precedence and truth tables.

9. **Mini Project: ATM Simulator Using Control Structures**  
   Build a complete ATM system combining loops, conditionals, and input validation. Practice real-world programming.

## Chapter 3: Foundations of Structure

Move into organizing logic. Understand functions and modular code.

### Lessons

10. **Functions Defined: Breaking Down Problems**  
    Create reusable functions to organize code. Understand function declaration, definition, and calling.

11. **Parameters and Return Values**  
    Pass data to functions and return results. Learn pass-by-value and pass-by-reference techniques.

12. **Scope Rules and Lifetime of Variables**  
    Master variable scope (local, global) and understand when variables are created and destroyed.

13. **Practical Exercise: Modular Grade Calculator**  
    Build a complete grade calculator using functions. Practice modular design and code organization.

## Chapter 4: The Warrior's Arsenal

Master core weapons: arrays, strings, and pointers.

### Lessons

14. **Arrays and Memory Layouts**  
    Work with fixed-size collections of data. Understand array indexing and memory organization.

15. **Strings and Character Manipulation**  
    Master C++ strings, character arrays, and string manipulation functions.

16. **Intro to Pointers and Addressing**  
    Understand pointers, memory addresses, and dereferencing. Learn pointer arithmetic basics.

17. **Pointers vs References: When and Why**  
    Compare pointers and references. Learn when to use each for efficient code.

18. **Dynamic Memory with new/delete**  
    Allocate and deallocate memory at runtime. Understand memory management and avoid leaks.

---

## Chapter 5: Structuring the Battlefield

Organize complex data through structures and user-defined types.

### Lessons

19. **Using Structs to Group Data**  
    Create custom data types with structs. Group related data into logical units.

20. **Nested Structs and Arrays of Structs**  
    Build complex data structures by nesting structs and creating collections of custom types.

21. **Introduction to Enums**  
    Create named constants with enums for more readable code. Use `enum class` for type safety.

22. **Building a Contact Book Using Structs**  
    Mini project: Build a complete contact management system using structs, arrays, and functions.

---

## Chapter 6: Object-Oriented Combat

Advance into object-oriented design with class hierarchies and code reuse.

### Lessons

23. **Classes and Objects in C++**  
    Transition from structs to classes. Understand encapsulation, public/private members, and methods.

24. **Constructors and Destructors**  
    Automatically initialize and clean up objects. Master constructor overloading and the RAII pattern.

25. **Encapsulation with Getters and Setters**  
    Protect data with private members. Implement controlled access through public methods.

26. **Inheritance and Code Reuse**  
    Build class hierarchies with inheritance. Understand base and derived classes, protected members.

27. **Polymorphism and Virtual Functions**  
    Enable runtime polymorphism with virtual functions. Create flexible, extensible code with abstract classes.

---

## Chapter 7: Elite Tools of the Trade

Take on C++'s most powerful tools: templates, exceptions, and the STL.

### Lessons

28. **Generic Programming with Templates**  
    Write code that works with any data type using function and class templates. Eliminate code duplication.

29. **Exception Handling for Robust Code**  
    Handle errors gracefully with try-catch-throw. Create custom exception classes for better error management.

30. **Using the Standard Template Library (STL)**  
    Master STL containers (vector, map, set), algorithms (sort, find), and iterators for efficient coding.

31. **Final Challenge: Build a C++ CRUD System with Error Handling**  
    Capstone project: Build a complete barangay management system integrating all concepts—OOP, templates, exceptions, STL, and file I/O.
