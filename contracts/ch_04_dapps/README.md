- Connect wallets (MetaMask) to your applications
- Read and write data to smart contracts from React interfaces
- Handle events and real-time updates
- Build complete dApp user experiences
- Implement advanced Web3 patterns and integrations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This chapter focuses on building modern Web3 applications using:

- **React** - Frontend framework for user interfaces
- **Ethers.js** - Ethereum JavaScript library for blockchain interactions
- **MetaMask** - Wallet integration and transaction signing
- **Web3 Hooks** - React hooks for Web3 functionality
- **Event Handling** - Real-time blockchain event processing

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, make sure you have:

1. ✅ Completed Chapter 1 (Basic Solidity)
2. ✅ Familiarity with JavaScript/React basics
3. ✅ MetaMask wallet installed
4. ✅ Access to testnet ETH (Sepolia/Goerli)
5. ✅ Understanding of smart contract deployment

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- 🔗 Integrate MetaMask and other wallets into React applications
- 📊 Read and display smart contract data in user-friendly interfaces
- ✍️ Execute smart contract functions through frontend forms
- 🎧 Listen to and handle blockchain events in real-time
- 🌐 Build responsive, multi-network dApp interfaces
- 🎨 Create intuitive user experiences for Web3 applications
- 🔐 Implement proper error handling and loading states
- 🚀 Deploy and maintain production-ready dApps

## 🌍 Real-World Context

Each lesson is set in the vibrant world of Filipino tech entrepreneurship, featuring:

- **Odessa** - A determined developer building her Web3 startup in BGC
- **Neri** - An experienced mentor guiding through complex implementations
- **Det** - A civic-minded developer creating community solutions
- **Barangay scenarios** - Local governance and community applications

These stories make learning more engaging while showcasing how Web3 technology can solve real-world problems in the Filipino context.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**:

   ```bash
   npm install ethers react react-dom
   npm install --dev @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

2. **Install MetaMask** browser extension

3. **Get testnet ETH** from faucets for Sepolia or Goerli

4. **Start with Lesson 1** and work through sequentially

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Practice regularly** - Build each interface step by step
- **Test on testnets** - Always test with testnet ETH first
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Web3 can be unpredictable
- **Focus on UX** - Make your dApps user-friendly
- **Stay updated** - Web3 libraries evolve quickly
