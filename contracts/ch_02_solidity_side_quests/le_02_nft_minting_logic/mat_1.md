# Side Quest 2: NFT Minting Logic

## Scenario:

After Neri’s legendary victory over Hackana—the malicious AI malware that crippled the Philippine economy—San Juan has become the epicenter of digital innovation. From her coding bunker deep in Pinaglabanan, Neri now leads the national defense force against rogue code remnants of Hackana still lurking in outdated contracts.

One morning, a breach alert flashes on the national blockchain monitor. Hackana’s old minions exploited a minting vulnerability in a popular NFT contract, bypassing the supply limit and flooding the system with duplicate NFTs. If this flaw spreads, it could erode the public’s trust in Web3 assets.

Now, Neri must patch the flawed NFT minting logic—ensuring only authorized entities can mint, and never more than the fixed maximum supply. The future of the San Juan Digital Renaissance depends on it.
