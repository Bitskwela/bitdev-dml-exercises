# Side Quest 5: Dynamic Pricing for Ride-Hailing App

## Scenario:

After the devastating digital attacks by Hackana, many systems in San Juan began to rebuild. However, one of the most used services—JuanRide, the local ride-hailing app—was left broken. Hackana's last malware forced the ride pricing to remain static, causing chaos during rush hours and leaving drivers underpaid.

Neri, the elite software engineer from Pinaglabanan, must now restore trust and fairness in the system. She needs to implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts the fare based on demand and time of day, ensuring both riders and drivers get fair value. It's a small piece of code—but it has massive impact for the everyday lives of Filipinos.
