# Side Quest 4: Multi-Signature Wallet

## Scenario:

The digital governance of San Juan is in chaos. Hackana’s minions struck again—this time targeting trust among the city’s digital board of directors. Important transfers of development funds are stalled, unable to proceed without consensus.

Neri, the legendary engineer, must restore order by building a _multi-signature wallet_ — a contract that requires majority approval from board members before any critical transaction can be executed. This time, trust must be enforced not by people, but by code.

## Mission Brief

- **Time Allotment**: 20 minutes
- **Solidity Topics Covered:** Multisig Wallets, Threshold Approval Logic.

**Hints:**

- Track approvals using a mapping.
- Require `approvalThreshold` to be met before executing.
