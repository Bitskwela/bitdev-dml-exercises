Neri, the legendary engineer, must restore order by building a _multi-signature wallet_ — a contract that requires majority approval from board members before any critical transaction can be executed. This time, trust must be enforced not by people, but by code.

## Mission Brief

- **Time Allotment**: 20 minutes
- **Solidity Topics Covered:** Multisig Wallets, Threshold Approval Logic.

**Hints:**

- Track approvals using a mapping.
