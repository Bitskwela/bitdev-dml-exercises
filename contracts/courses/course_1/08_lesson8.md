# Mapping the problem away

## Scene

Neri tracks Hackanaâ€™s digital trail and discovers itâ€™s siphoning funds and data by exploiting poorly managed user records in centralized systems. To counteract, she decides to build a decentralized data registry using Solidityâ€™s mapping, which efficiently organizes and retrieves data.

Neri realizes that by designing a robust mapping-based solution, she can secure sensitive data like user balances, records, or permissions against tampering.

## Solidity Topics: `mapping`

A `mapping` is a reference type in Solidity that associates keys to values. It functions like a dictionary or hash table and is highly efficient for lookups.

**Syntax:**

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
```

**Key Characteristics:**

- Keys are unique and canâ€™t be iterated directly (no for loop).
- Common key types: `address`, `uint`, `bytes32`.
- Common value types: `uint`, `bool`, `string`, or even nested `mappings`.

**How to use mapping in Solidity**

- Declare a Mapping:

  - Syntax: `mapping(keyType => valueType) visibility name;`
  - Example: `mapping(address => uint256) public balances;`
    - **Explanation**: This maps the user address and their corresponding balances
      - `keyType: address` (user address).
      - `valueType: uint256` (user balance).

- Setting a mappingâ€™s value:

  - Use the `mappingName[key] = value` syntax.

    **Example:** `balances[msg.sender] = 1000;`

    - **Explanation**: Weâ€™re assigning 1000 balance to the senderâ€™s address

- Retrieving a mapping value:

  - Access the value using the `mappingName[key]` syntax.

    **Example:** `uint256 myBalance = balances[msg.sender];`

    - **Explanation:** Weâ€™re retrieving the senderâ€™s balance by referencing itâ€™s wallet address as a parameter

- Update a Value: - Simply assign a new value to the key.
  - **Example**: `balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] + 500;`
    - **Explanation**: Weâ€™re assigning additional `500` balance on the senderâ€™s current balance

## Task for Learners

- Use a `mapping` to create a simple ledger that stores user balances.
- Add functionality to:

  - Update balances for a given user.
  - Retrieve the balance of a specific user.

## Smart Contract Activity

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AntiHackanaLedger {
    // ðŸš© Task 1: Declare a mapping to track user balances
    mapping(address => uint256) public userBalances;

    // ðŸš© Task 2: Function to update user balance
    function updateBalance(address _user, uint256 _newBalance) public {
        userBalances[_user] = _newBalance; // Update the user's balance
    }

    // ðŸš© Task 3: Function to retrieve user balance
    function getBalance(address _user) public view returns (uint256) {
        return userBalances[_user]; // Return the user's balance
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Activity

**Variables Defined:**

`userBalances`: A mapping that associates a userâ€™s wallet address (`address`) with their balance (`uint256`).

**Key Functions:**

- `updateBalance`:
  Takes a userâ€™s address (`_user`) and a new balance (`_newBalance`) as inputs.
  Updates the `userBalances` mapping with the new value for the specified address.

- `getBalance`:
  Accepts a userâ€™s address (`_user`) as input.
  Fetches and returns the associated balance from the `userBalances` mapping.
