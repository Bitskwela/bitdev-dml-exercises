# Waking Up to Chaos

## Scene

Neri starts her day in San Juan City. Her news feed is filled with reports of system glitches: double charges on transport, failed payments at palengkes (wet markets), and delays in online banking.

On her way to work, she encounters issues like malfunctioning jeepney QR scanners and overhears a vendor struggling with a GCash payment.

Neri begins her journey to revolutionize the Philippines' chaotic systems by revisiting what she learned about blockchain. She knows that blockchainâ€™s transparency, immutability, and decentralization can prevent issues like double charges and payment failures.

To help her start, let's dive into the fundamentals of Solidity: Contracts, State Variables, and Pragma. These are the building blocks of any smart contract, much like how jeepney routes and stops are vital to organized commuting.

Neri realizes that just like her morning starts with a solid plan (coffee, commute, and news), any blockchain application starts with a contract â€” a blueprint for defining what the system should do. She decides to create her first blockchain contract to simulate a simple, immutable record-keeping system for payments.

## Solidity topics

### Contracts

> A contract in Solidity is like a container for the logic and data of your application. Itâ€™s where you define what your application does and how it behaves.

### Pragma

> The pragma specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to use, ensuring your code works as intended without unexpected behavior. Itâ€™s like specifying the operating system version for running an app.

### State Variables

> These are variables that hold data, similar to a notebook where Neri might jot down payment records from jeepneys or palengkes. They are stored permanently on the blockchain.

#### Sample syntax

A `contract` in Solidity is similar to a class in object-oriented programming. It is the core building block of Ethereum applications, where you define variables, functions, and logic.

```solidity
contract MyFirstContract {
    // Contract content goes here
}
```

The `pragma` directive specifies the Solidity compiler version the contract is compatible with. This ensures your code runs as intended with a specific compiler version.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

State variables are used to store persistent data on the blockchain. Their values are saved to the Ethereum blockchain, making them accessible even after contract execution ends.

```solidity
contract StateVariablesExample {
    // Example state variables
    uint256 public count; // Unsigned integer to store a number
    address public owner; // Address type to store Ethereum addresses
    string public greeting; // String type to store text
}
```

## Activity

Build your first Solidity Smart Contract
Letâ€™s build a contract for Neri's imaginary "**PalengkePay**" system to keep track of vendorsâ€™ names and payment amounts.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

// ðŸš© TODO: Add another state variable to store the payer's name
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Define a contract named PalengkePay
contract PalengkePay {
    // State variable to store vendor name
    string public vendorName;

    // State variable to store the total payment amount
    uint256 public totalPayments;

    // ðŸš© TODO: Add another state variable to store the payer's name
    string public payerName;

    // Function to set vendor details and payment
    function recordPayment(string memory _vendorName, uint256 _amount) public {
        vendorName = _vendorName; // Set the vendor's name
        totalPayments = _amount; // Update the total payments

        // ðŸš© TODO: Update this function to also record the payer's name
        payerName = "Replace this with your name :)"; // Replace this line with your name
    }
}
```

### Task for Students

- Set the pragma version of
- Add a new state variable (`payerName`) to store the payer's name.
- Update the `recordPayment` function to allow input for the payer's name.
- Compile and Deploy: Test the updated contract in IDE.
- Interact with the Contract: Use the `recordPayment` function to enter a vendor name, amount, and payer name (e.g., `"Mang Pedro"`, `500`, `"Juan Dela Cruz"`).

### What the Code Does

**Pragma Directive**: `pragma` ensures compatibility with Solidity version `0.8.0` or higher.

**State Variables**:

- `vendorName`: Stores the name of the vendor (e.g., "Aling Nena's Sari-Sari Store").
- `totalPayments`: Keeps track of payments made.

**Function**: The `recordPayment` function allows users to set a vendor name and record a payment amount.
