# Side Quest 1: Token Transfer with Approval System

## Scenario:

The San Juan Digital Payment System is recovering, but Hackanaâ€™s minions tampered with the ERC20 token approval mechanism, creating issues in transferring funds securely between vendors and customers. Neri must fix it.

- Time Allotment: 20 minutes
- Solidity Topics Covered: ERC20, Allowances, and Approvals.
- Checklist: Approvals should restrict overspending; tokens transfer correctly.

## TODO:

Create a function to approve and transfer tokens securely.
Prevent overspending by validating allowances.

## Code activity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// ERC20 Mock Contract
contract PaymentFixer {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowances;

    constructor() {
        // Initial token allocation
        balances[msg.sender] = 1000;
    }

    // ðŸš© TODO: Implement the approve function
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public {
        allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    }

    // ðŸš© TODO: Fix the transferFrom logic to respect allowances
    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) public {
        require(allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount, "Allowance exceeded");
        require(balances[sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
    }
}

```

**Hints:**

- Modify `transferFrom` to ensure allowances are updated after each transaction.
- Double-check balance and allowance conditions.

## Expected answers (flagged)

```solidity
// ðŸš© ANSWER: Deduct from allowances
allowances[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;

// ðŸš© ANSWER: Update sender and recipient balances
balances[sender] -= amount;
balances[recipient] += amount;
```
