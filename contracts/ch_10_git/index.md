# Course 10: Git – Version Control Mastery

## 🚀 Prologue: The Historian's Craft – Recording Every Change

_"Every change tells a story. With Git, you become the historian of your code."_

Picture this: You've built amazing software—from smart contracts to web applications. You've learned to code, to design, to architect solutions. But there's one critical skill separating hobby developers from professional engineers: **the ability to work with others**.

Whether you're collaborating with teammates in your barangay's tech startup, contributing to open-source projects, or deploying to production, Git is the foundation. It's not just a tool—it's the system that lets teams of developers work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes. It's the safety net that lets you undo mistakes. It's the narrative of your project's evolution.

### 🌟 Your Journey Awaits

In this chapter, you'll transform from a solo developer into a team player and open-source contributor. You'll discover:

- **The Foundation**: How Git works, what version control really means, and why distributed systems matter
- **The Craft of Branching**: Creating parallel development streams, merging safely, resolving conflicts like a pro
- **The Art of Collaboration**: Working with remote repositories, creating pull requests, building team workflows
- **The Power of History**: Advanced techniques for managing code history, investigating bugs, and recovering from mistakes
- **The Discipline of Professionalism**: Commit message standards, semantic versioning, and automation through hooks
- **The Open Source Spirit**: Contributing to projects beyond your control, learning from the global community, and giving back

### 🎯 What You'll Master

By completing this course, you'll be able to:

1. **Manage Code Locally** - Create repositories, make commits, view history
2. **Master Branching** - Create branches, merge changes, resolve conflicts
3. **Collaborate Effectively** - Push to remotes, pull updates, create pull requests
4. **Work Professionally** - Write semantic commits, tag releases, implement hooks
5. **Investigate & Recover** - Find bugs with bisect, blame authors, recover lost work
6. **Contribute to Open Source** - Fork projects, submit PRs, engage with communities

### 🏛️ The Course Structure

Your journey through Git mastery unfolds in **6 learning arcs**:

#### **Arc 1: Git Foundations** (Lessons 1-5)

_Learn what Git is and perform basic version control._

- Le 01: What is Git? – History, purpose, distributed systems
- Le 02: Creating Your First Repository – `git init`, .git directory
- Le 03: Staging & Committing – `git add`, `git commit`, messages
- Le 04: Viewing History – `git log`, `git diff`
- Le 05: Undoing Changes – `git restore`, `git reset`, `git revert`

#### **Arc 2: Branching & Merging** (Lessons 6-12)

_Master parallel development through strategic branching._

- Le 06: Understanding Branches – HEAD, pointers, main branch
- Le 07: Creating & Switching Branches – `git branch`, `git checkout -b`
- Le 08: Merging Branches (Fast-Forward) – Simple merges
- Le 09: Handling Merge Conflicts – Markers, resolution strategies
- Le 10: The Branch Workflow – Feature branches, naming conventions
- Le 11: Cleaning Up Branches – Deletion, repository hygiene
- Le 12: Branch Strategies – Gitflow model, structured releases

#### **Arc 3: Collaboration Patterns** (Lessons 13-18)

_Enable teamwork with remote repositories and pull requests._

- Le 13: Remote Repositories – Adding remotes, understanding origin
- Le 14: Pushing & Pulling – `git push`, `git pull`
- Le 15: Fetching Updates – `git fetch`, safe preview of changes
- Le 16: Pull Requests – Code review, iteration
- Le 17: Handling Remote Rejections – Non-fast-forward errors
- Le 18: Collaboration Mini-Project – Team workflow simulation

#### **Arc 4: Advanced Git** (Lessons 19-24)

_Power-user techniques for complex scenarios._

- Le 19: Rebasing – Rebase vs merge, linear history
- Le 20: Interactive Rebasing – `git rebase -i`, squashing commits
- Le 21: Cherry-Picking – Applying specific commits
- Le 22: Stashing – `git stash`, temporary work storage
- Le 23: Reflog & Recovery – Finding lost commits
- Le 24: Advanced Workflows – `git bisect`, `git blame`

#### **Arc 5: Git Workflows & Best Practices** (Lessons 25-28)

_Professional standards and automation._

- Le 25: Commit Message Standards – Conventional commits
- Le 26: .gitignore & Sensitive Data – Protecting secrets
- Le 27: Tags & Releases – Semantic versioning
- Le 28: Git Hooks & Automation – Pre-commit checks

#### **Arc 6: Capstone & Open Source** (Lessons 29-30)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- **Git installed** on your computer (covered in Lesson 1)
- **A GitHub account** (free tier is sufficient, covered in Lesson 13)
- **A text editor** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- **Basic command-line familiarity** (from previous courses)
- **Completion of Ch 1-5** (recommended but not required)

## 🌏 Filipino Context: A Barangay of Developers

Imagine a growing tech community in your barangay. Different developers are working on different features simultaneously—one is building a market platform, another is fixing a delivery system bug, a third is preparing a release. Without Git, chaos would ensue. With Git, you have:

- **Peace of mind** - Every change is recorded and reversible
- **Team coordination** - Multiple people working simultaneously without conflicts
- **Quality control** - Code review before anything reaches production
- **Professional practices** - Standards that real-world teams follow

This course teaches you the Git workflows that power not just your barangay's startup, but global open-source projects. You'll learn to think like a professional developer working in collaborative environments—because that's the future of software development.
