# Le 07 Assessment: Creating and Switching Branches

## Question 1: Basic Commands
When you create a new branch with `git branch feature/voting` and then switch to it with `git switch feature/voting`, what has changed in your working directory? What hasn't changed?

## Question 2: One-Step Creation
Explain the advantage of `git switch -c feature/voting` (create and switch) versus doing it in two steps. When might you still want two separate steps?

## Question 3: Branch Independence
You're on feature/voting and make commits. Maria is on feature/payment. How are your changes independent? What happens if you accidentally push to the wrong branch?

## Question 4: Real Workflow
The San Juan Payment System needs three simultaneous features: payments, audit-logging, and security. Create three branch names following conventions. Explain why clear naming matters.

## Question 5: Team Scenario
Dev Sam creates feature/security but forgets to document what he's working on. The London developer sees this branch. What problems might occur? How could better communication help?

## Question 6: Personal Development
How have you structured your own projects? Would branching have made it easier? Describe a real scenario where creating a feature branch first would have prevented problems.
