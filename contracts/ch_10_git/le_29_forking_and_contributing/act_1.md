# Le 29 Assessment: Forking and Open Source Contribution

## Question 1: The Fork Workflow
Explain why you must fork a project before contributing. What does forking give you that you don't have with just cloning?

## Question 2: Upstream and Origin
After forking and cloning, you have two remotes: origin and upstream. What does each do? Why do you need both?

## Question 3: Sync Strategy
The official project (upstream) has new commits. You have unpushed commits on your fork. How do you sync without losing your work?

## Question 4: Pull Request Communication
You submit a pull request to an open-source project. The maintainer asks for changes. Walk through the conversation and revision process.

## Question 5: Global Open Source
Open-source projects have contributors worldwide. How does Git (branches, forks, PRs, remotes) enable this distributed collaboration?

## Question 6: Career Growth
Contributing to open-source is impressive on a resume. How does mastering Git make you a more valuable developer in the open-source community?
