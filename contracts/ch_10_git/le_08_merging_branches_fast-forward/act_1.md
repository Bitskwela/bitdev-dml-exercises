# Le 08 Assessment: Fast-Forward Merging

## Question 1: Pointer Movement
Draw or describe what happens to pointers when you do a fast-forward merge. Why can Git just move the pointer instead of creating a merge commit?

## Question 2: When Fast-Forward Works
You're merging feature/voting into main. Fast-forward merge is possible. What does this tell you about the commit history? What would be different if fast-forward wasn't possible?

## Question 3: Cleanup After Merge
After merging feature/voting into main, Maria deletes the feature/voting branch. Can she recover the commits? Why or why not?

## Question 4: Team Workflow
The Barangay Blockchain has three feature branches ready to merge. They can all fast-forward merge. What does this tell you about the team's workflow discipline? Is this good or concerning?

## Question 5: Deployment Scenario
Friday before release. Four features are merged via fast-forward to main. Monday morning, a bug is discovered in one feature. How would you find which commits caused it? Would it be easier or harder with fast-forward merges versus explicit merge commits?

## Question 6: Reflection
Some teams disable fast-forward merges (always creating explicit merge commits). Why might a team make that choice, especially for a global deployment?
