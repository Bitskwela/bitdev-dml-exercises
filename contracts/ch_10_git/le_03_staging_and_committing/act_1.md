# Activity: Staging & Committing

## Your Task

Practice the staging workflow by making commits with granular changes.

### Question 1: The Staging Workflow
**Create three files in a test directory:**
- `discount.js` with a function to calculate discounts
- `logger.js` with a logging function
- `email.js` with an email placeholder

**Then, stage and commit ONLY the `discount.js` file with an appropriate message. Show the commands and explain why you wouldn't commit all three at once.**

(Your answer here - include the git commands and your reasoning)

---

### Question 2: Viewing Staged Changes
**Modify both `logger.js` and `email.js`. Then:**
1. Run `git diff` and `git diff --staged`
2. Stage only `logger.js`
3. Run both commands again

**What's the difference in output before and after staging? Explain what each command shows.**

(Your answer here - include the command outputs and your explanation)

### Question 3: Commit Message Quality
**For a change that fixes a bug where users couldn't apply discount codes:**

Write:
- A BAD commit message
- A GOOD commit message
- Explain why the good one is better

### Question 4: Multiple Small Commits vs. One Large Commit
**Your team has two approaches:**

Option A: Commit everything at once - "Updated payment system"
Option B: Three commits:
- "Fix discount calculation"
- "Add payment logging"
- "Update email validation"

**Which approach is better for a team deploying globally? Why?**

### Question 5: Real-World Scenario
**You've modified 5 files for different features. One feature is tested and ready. Others still have bugs. What Git commands would you use to commit only the ready feature?**
