# Le 06 Assessment: Understanding Branches

Answer the following questions in your own words. These are free-form—focus on understanding, not syntax.

## Question 1: Basic Concept
Explain what a branch is in Git using the pointer analogy. How is a branch different from just having multiple folders?

## Question 2: HEAD and Isolation
What does HEAD point to, and why does it matter for branch isolation? Give an example from your own development work.

## Question 3: Naming Convention
Why might branch naming conventions (like feature/voting, bugfix/security) matter for a global team? Name three branches that would be useful for the San Juan Payment System.

## Question 4: Parallel Development
Maria and Dev Sam want to work on different features simultaneously. Explain how branches enable this without interfering with each other's work.

## Question 5: Complex Scenario
The Barangay Blockchain has 12 active branches. A new London developer arrives. Why is good branch hygiene and naming important for helping her understand what work is happening?

## Question 6: Reflection
How does the concept of branches relate to the theme "Beyond the Islands"? How do branches enable distributed teams to work independently yet collaboratively?
