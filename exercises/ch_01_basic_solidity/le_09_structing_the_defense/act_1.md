### Task for Learners

- Define a struct called Customer to store:
  - A customerâ€™s name (string).
  - Their wallet address (address).
  - Their current balance (uint256).
- Write functions to:
  - Add a new customer.
  - Retrieve customer details.

### Breakdown of Activity

**Struct Defined:**

- Customer:

  - `name` (`string`): Customerâ€™s name.
  - `walletAddress` (`address`): Customerâ€™s wallet address.
  - `balance` (`uint256`): Customerâ€™s current balance.

- Mapping Used:

  - `customers`: Stores `Customer` structs, keyed by their wallet address.

- Key Functions:
  - `addCustomer`:
    - Accepts the customerâ€™s name and initial balance as inputs.
    - Creates a `Customer` struct instance and assigns it to the customers mapping for the senderâ€™s address.
  - `getCustomer`:
    - Takes a wallet address as input.
    - Retrieves the associated `Customer` struct and returns its fields: `name`, `walletAddress`, and `balance`.
