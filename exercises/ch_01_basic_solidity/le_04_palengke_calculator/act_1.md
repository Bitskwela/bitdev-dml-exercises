# Tasks for Learners

- Use math operations to calculate the total cost of goods based on quantity and price.
- Apply subtraction to compute the change owed to the customer after payment.
- Create a multiplication function for discounts or bulk purchases.
- Use division to fairly split group payments.

### Breakdown for Learners

- `calculateTotal`

  - Purpose: Calculates the total price for multiple items.
  - Inputs: Price per item and quantity.
  - Output: Total price (price per item Ã— quantity).

- `calculateChange`

  - Purpose: Calculates the change to give back to a customer.
  - Inputs: Total cost and amount paid by the customer.
  - Output: The difference (payment âˆ’ total cost).
  - Error Check: Ensures the payment is enough (cannot be less than the total cost).

- `applyDiscount`

  - Purpose: Applies a discount to the total cost.
  - Inputs: Total cost and discount percentage.
  - Output: The discounted price.
  - Error Check: Ensures the discount percentage is valid (cannot be more than 100%).

- `splitBill`
  - Purpose: Splits the total cost equally among a group of people.
  - Inputs: Total cost and group size.
  - Output: Each person's share of the cost.
  - Error Check: Ensures group size is greater than 0.

### Key Points:

- Math Operations: Used for calculations like total cost, change, and discounts (multiplication, subtraction, division).
- Error Handling with require(): Ensures valid inputs and prevents mistakes (e.g., not enough payment or invalid discount).
- Modular Functions: Each function handles one specific task, making the contract easy to read and reuse.

### Why It Matters:

- This contract simulates everyday transactions, like buying goods, paying for them, and splitting the cost in a group. It helps make transactions more transparent and automated, which could be useful for managing sales in markets (like palengkes).
